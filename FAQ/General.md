# API Usage FAQs

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q: Why am I encountering errors in my API requests?
**Ans.** Errors in API requests can occur for various reasons, such as missing or incorrect parameters, invalid URLs, or server-related issues. Ensure that you provide the necessary input, use valid image URLs, and check for any error messages returned by the API. If the issue persists, refer to the error codes for more specific information.

### Q: When can I expect a response from the API, and is there a wait time?
**Ans.** The response time from the API may vary depending on the complexity of the request and server load. In some cases, the wait time can be as high as 10 minutes. Please be patient, and if you encounter prolonged delays, consider checking your input parameters and referring to the error codes for potential issues.

### Q: What do the error codes mean in the API responses?
**Ans.** Error codes in API responses provide information about the nature of the issue encountered. Common error codes include 400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors, and more. Refer to the specific error code in the response to understand the reason for the error. Detailed explanations for each error code are available in the API documentation.

### Q: Is there a limit on the number of requests in the free plan, and when does it reset?
**Ans.** The free plan includes a limit of 1000 requests per day. This limit resets every day, allowing you to make additional requests once the daily quota is refreshed. Keep track of your usage, and if you reach the daily limit, consider upgrading to a premium plan for higher usage limits.

### Q: How can I handle long wait times or delays in API responses?
**Ans.** If you experience long wait times, first ensure that your input parameters are correct. Additionally, consider optimizing your requests or spreading them out over time to avoid exceeding rate limits. For real-time or critical applications, you may explore premium plans that offer faster response times and higher usage limits.

### Q: What should I do if I consistently receive errors despite correct inputs?
**Ans.** If you consistently encounter errors, double-check your input parameters, ensure you are using valid image URLs, and refer to the error codes for specific details. If the issue persists, reach out to the API support team for assistance, providing details about your request and any error messages received.

### Q: Can I access premium features with the free plan, or are there limitations?
**Ans.** The free plan provides access to basic features with certain limitations, including a daily request limit. Premium features, faster response times, and higher usage limits are available in premium plans. Consider upgrading if you require additional resources and enhanced functionality.

### Q: Are there specific guidelines for handling different error scenarios?
**Ans.** Yes, the API documentation includes detailed guidelines for handling various error scenarios. Review the documentation to understand how to interpret error codes, troubleshoot common issues, and implement best practices when interacting with the API.
